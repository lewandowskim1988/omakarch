# Omakarch

This setup is heavily inspired by [omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub) which is great project created by [DHH](https://dhh.dk/).
Since I am not using Ubuntu so I rewrite it to match my operating system which is Arch base linux called [endeavouros](https://endeavouros.com/)
I also added few tools that I am using as a DevOps engineer which probably are not needed if you are not working with infrastructure.
